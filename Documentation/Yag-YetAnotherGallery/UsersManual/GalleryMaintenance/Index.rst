There is a section for gallery maintenance in the backend. You can
open it via the dropdownlist in the YAG module:

Select 'Gallery Maintainance' there and you will see the following
screen:

Besides a statistics of galleries, albums and images on your site,
there is also some information about cached files and the amount of
data used for image files on your harddisk.

The last two links of the site are used for maintaining the cached
files. The cache is filled automatically if an image is requested in a
specific size and configuration.

When clicking on 'Clear resolution file cache', a message informs you,
that the cache has been deleted.

You can build all resolutions at once, this speeds up the page
creation in frontend for the first user of your site. When you click
on 'Build resolution file cache', there is a progress bar, that shows
you the progress of rebuilding the cache:
