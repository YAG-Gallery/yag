Setting up your first Gallery
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After setting up a page for yag as described before, you will get a
screen like this, if you open the page using the gallery module:

|img-22|

So let's get our first gallery created. Click on the 'Add gallery'
link and you get a input form like this:

|img-23|

Fill in some text as name and description and press 'Save'. Now you
should have a first gallery in your list:

|img-24|

So that's it – you just created your first gallery. Let's go on and
create some albums inside this gallery.
