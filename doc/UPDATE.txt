# Update from a Version <= 2.0.0
--------------------------------

AG version 2.0 and above uses Sysfolders to store its records instead of storing the data on PID 0. For that reason you have to do some manual adjustments when upgrading from version 1.x to 2.x. 
Before you proceed with the steps described below, make sure, you have created a sysfolder for yag as described in section “Setting up a sysfolder for YAG”. Without this sysfolder, YAG won't work properly anymore!
After installing the current YAG, pt_extlist  and pt_extbase you first have to create a Sysfolder to store the existing YAG records in. Refer to the section Installation for further details.
Select the “Gallery” Module and select the Sysfolder from the pagetree. The module shows the message “There are no galleries available yet.“. Chnage to the Gallery Maintenance Module using the module selector:

The Maintenance Module now shows the database update wizzard.

The wizzard again explains what to do. Simply enter the PID of the created Sysfolder and all records are moved there.
The last step you have to do, is to manually open every YAG instance on your pages, and select the PID the records are now stored on (hopefully you have not too much ;) ).

# Update from a Version <= 1.2.0
--------------------------------

There is a new dependency to pt_extbase which came with version 1.2.0. Please repeat the following steps to make an update to version 1.2.0

1. Go to the Extension Manager and download & install 'pt_extbase' 0.0.1 from TER
2. Download & install 'pt_extlist' version 0.3.0 from TER
3. Download & install 'yag' version 1.2.0 from TER
4. Uninstall 'pt_tools' 
5. Check for everything concerning YAG to be still running
6. Open the install tool and do a database compare
7. Remove non-used tables from pt_extlist

That's it.

--------------------------------
# Update from a Version <= 1.1.0
--------------------------------

There was a small database change, wich came with version 1.1.1 If you have a version of YAG smaller than 1.1.1 you have to do the following steps to upgrade:

1. BACKUP ALL YAG_* DATABASE TABLES
2. Install the update
3. Hit the "make update" button to run the database update
4. execute the following query on your database:

UPDATE tx_yag_domain_model_album a SET a.gallery = (SELECT m.uid_local FROM tx_yag_gallery_album_mm m WHERE m.uid_foreign = a.uid LIMIT 1)

Thats all.
